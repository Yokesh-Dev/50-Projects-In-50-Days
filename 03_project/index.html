        <p>
          1. Introduction: · Landing a coding job in a year without a computer
          science degree ispossible.·Introduction of John and Francisco as
          examples of successful career transitions through coding. <br> Choosing
          a Learning Path: · Avoid the mistake of learning multiple languages
          without purpose. · Decide on the desired job role (e.g., web
          development, game development) to focus learning efforts efficiently.<br> 
          3. Finding a Learning Path: · Research and follow established learning
          paths relevant to chosen career goals. · Utilize online resources and
          roadmaps specific to the desired field, like web development or data
          science. <br> 4. Effective Learning Strategies: · Avoid scattered learning
          from random tutorials or overly lengthy courses. · Choose structured
          courses from reputable instructors and commit to completing them. ·
          Emphasize practical problem-solving skills over rote memorization.<br>  5.
          Practice and Projects: · Regular practice is essential for skill
          development in coding. · Utilize platforms like ChatGPT for exercise
          and project ideas tailored to skill level. · Showcase projects on
          GitHub for visibility and community feedback.<br>  6. Preparing for
          Interviews: · Recognize the importance of preparation for coding
          interviews, especially for top tech companies. · Study data structures
          and algorithms, commonly tested topics, even without a computer
          science degree. · Utilize resources like LeetCode for practice and
          mock interviews for feedback.<br>
